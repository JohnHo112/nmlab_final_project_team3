This version introduces a new DID method targeting the IOTA UTXO ledger. This method works fundamentally differently from the previous method and introduces new capabilities to interact with Layer 1 entities like native tokens, NFTs and smart contracts.
\n\n
This is an early alpha release, so there may be breaking changes in upcoming versions that invalidate DIDs created with this version. The method at this point is only intended for experimentation.

Note: Identities created with the earlier versions cannot be resolved with this version of the library.
