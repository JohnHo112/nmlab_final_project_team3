This release introduces a breaking change for diff updates created by versions `v0.5.0-dev.1` and `v0.5.0-dev.2` (previous diff updates from `<=v0.4.0` are already incompatible due to breaking changes to the document and message structure in `v0.5.0-dev.1`). To migrate, please publish an integration update containing all diff changes to prevent unexpected changes to resolved DID Documents.
